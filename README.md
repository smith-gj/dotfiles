# dotfiles
Collection of configuration files for my Linux machine. 

Uses tewi-font, fontawesome, and a few others. Most things you should be able to install with a package manager. A few you'll have to build from the source or find an install script somewhere (like with termite). The rest of this should work out of the box with little configuration.
