# dotfiles
Collection of configuration files for my Linux machine. 

Uses tewi-font, fontawesome, and a few others. Most things you should be able to install with a package manager. A few you'll have to build from the source or find an install script somewhere (like with termite). The rest of this should work out of the box with little configuration.

I make updates to these pretty much every day, so I'll try and keep them updated every so often. I won't get it every day since it's not entirely important that I keep these backups up to date, since they're pretty much just cosmetic. However, I'll at least update them weekly.
